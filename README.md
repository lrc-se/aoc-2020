Advent of Code 2020
===================

This year's puzzles will be solved using Vue 3 and TypeScript, exploring the possibilities and limitations of both.

Running
-------

```bash
$ yarn install    # install dependencies
$ yarn serve      # start development server
$ yarn lint       # lint and auto-fix files
$ yarn lint-nofix # lint and don't auto-fix files
$ yarn build      # build for production
```

When building for production, the base path can be changed by defining the `VUE_BASE_PATH` environment variable.
Also remember to [configure server routing](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations).

Puzzles
-------

### Day 1

Solved with simple, performant `for` loops.

### Day 2

Using regex matching, destructuring and functional techniques.
